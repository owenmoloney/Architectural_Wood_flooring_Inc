HOW TO TEST THE BLUEPRINT MODE
===============================

I just created a test blueprint: test_blueprint.png

TEST DATA FOR THE SAMPLE BLUEPRINT:
-----------------------------------

When testing blueprint_mode.py with test_blueprint.png, use these test values:

ROOMS (4 rooms shown):
--------------------
1. Living Room: 20' × 12' = 240 sq ft
2. Kitchen: 15' × 12' = 180 sq ft  
3. Bedroom: 15' × 12' = 180 sq ft
4. Bathroom: 8' × 10' = 80 sq ft

For obstacles, you can add (optional):
- Living Room: Fireplace (20 sq ft)
- Kitchen: Island (25 sq ft)
- Bedroom: Closet (15 sq ft)

EMPLOYEES:
---------
- John: $35/hour
- Mike: $22/hour

JOB PARAMETERS:
--------------
Days: 2
Sanding cost per sq ft: $1.00
Customer provides wood: No
Material cost per sq ft: $8.50
Pickup fee: $150.00

HOW TO RUN THE TEST:
-------------------
python3 blueprint_mode.py

When prompted for blueprint path, enter:
"Sample Ground Floor Plan.pdf"

(Or use: test_blueprint.png for the simple test image)

Then enter the test data above!


ALTERNATIVE - NO BLUEPRINT:
---------------------------
You can also test without a blueprint file:
- Just press Enter when asked for blueprint path
- The program will work fine without showing an image
- Enter the same test data


ALTERNATIVE - REAL BLUEPRINT:
-----------------------------
You can also use any real blueprint/image:
1. Download from: https://www.sample.net/business/plans/floor-plans/
2. Save as: my_blueprint.jpg (or .png, .pdf)
3. Use that file path instead

Or use ANY image file - it doesn't have to be a blueprint!
The program will try to display it for reference.
