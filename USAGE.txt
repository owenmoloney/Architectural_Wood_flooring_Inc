FLOORING CALCULATOR - QUICK REFERENCE
=====================================

TWO MODES AVAILABLE:
--------------------

1. STANDARD MODE (main.py)
   - Simple, straightforward input
   - Direct entry of square feet for rooms
   - Best for: Quick estimates without blueprints

2. BLUEPRINT MODE (blueprint_mode.py)
   - Visual blueprint reference while entering
   - Choice of Length×Width or direct square feet
   - Review screen before calculation
   - Best for: Accurate measurements with blueprints


CALCULATION ENGINE:
-------------------
Both modes use the EXACT SAME calculation engine
- Sanding cost per sq ft
- Labor cost (multiple employees, hourly rates, days)
- Material cost (customer provides OR company provides)
- 10% waste factor on materials
- Obstacle exclusions


KEY DIFFERENCES:
----------------
Standard Mode:
- Faster input for experienced users
- Direct prompt flow

Blueprint Mode:
- Displays blueprint image for reference
- Two input options: L×W or sq ft
- Review/confirm step before calculating

• Detailed blueprint-based quotes → blueprint_mode.py

Both produce identical cost calculations!
